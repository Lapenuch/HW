               William Shakespeare[a] (c. 23 April 1564[b] – 23 April 1616)[c] was an English playwright, poet and
               actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent
               dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" or simply "the Bard". His
               extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems
               and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major
               living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains
               arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and
               reinterpreted.
               Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne
               Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585
               and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner ("sharer") of a
               playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of
               King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613) he appears to have retired to
               Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has
               stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his
               religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written
               by others.
               Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily
               comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote
               mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be
               among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies (also known as
               romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.
